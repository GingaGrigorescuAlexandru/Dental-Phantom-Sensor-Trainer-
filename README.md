# Dental Phantom Sensor Trainer

## Overview
The **Dental Phantom Sensor Trainer** is an educational desktop application that collects, visualizes, and analyzes real-time data from sensors embedded in a dental training phantom. 

It allows dental students to:
- Practice interpreting sensor data in a controlled environment.
- Identify over-limit readings and respond appropriately.
- Understand the dynamics of temperature and pressure within dental procedures.
- Develop practical skills for clinical scenarios without working on real patients.

## Features
- **Real-time monitoring** of temperature and pressure from dental training phantoms.
- **Interactive graphs** with Plotly.js for clear visualization.
- **Alert notifications** when readings exceed thresholds.
